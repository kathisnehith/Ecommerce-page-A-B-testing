# Ecommerce-page-A-B-testing

## Introduction:

This project revolves around an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce company to evaluate the effectiveness of a new webpage design aimed at increasing user conversionsâ€”the percentage of visitors who purchase the company's product or service. The dataset encompasses user interactions and conversion metrics across two groups: a control group exposed to the original webpage and a treatment group experiencing the redesigned version. Our primary objective was to leverage statistical techniques and rigorous data analysis to determine whether the revised webpage treatment yielded a statistically significant uplift in conversions compared to the control.
